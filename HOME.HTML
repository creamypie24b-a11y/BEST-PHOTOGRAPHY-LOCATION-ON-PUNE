<center><h2>INFORMATION OF PHOTOGRAPHY LOCATION</h2></center>


<p>Photography location info involves finding places for shoots (using Maps, Pinterest,
 location scouting), understanding geotagging (EXIF data showing where a photo was taken), and
 using apps like Google Photos to see or add location details to your own images, helping you find 
inspiration or identify past shoots. For practical shooting, consider sun, background, crowds, and seasons,
 and always check land ownership (public/private). 
Finding Locations
Google Maps & Satellite View: Great for scouting areas, parks, interesting architecture,
 or natural features.
Social Media: Search hashtags like #photographylocation, #locationideas, or specific city/
landmark tags on Instagram, Pinterest.
Specialized Sites: Shutterstock, Adobe Stock for inspiration or stock images of locations.
Local Scouting: Explore your area for unique spots, checking if they're public or private. 
Information on Your Own Photos (Geotagging)
EXIF Data: Digital photos contain embedded data (EXIF) including GPS coordinates if enabled, 
showing where it was taken.
Google Photos: View location on a map within the app; you can also add or remove locations.
Online EXIF Viewers: LinangData can show location data on a map.
Camera Settings: Turn on "Add location" or "Add location info" in your phone's camera settings to<br>
 automatically geotag. 
Tips for Location Photography
Light: Check the sun's position for open shade or interesting shadows.
Backgrounds: Look for clean, uncluttered backgrounds.
Season & Time: Consider how the season or time of day affects the location.
Crowds: Avoid overly busy spots for portraits.<br></p>
